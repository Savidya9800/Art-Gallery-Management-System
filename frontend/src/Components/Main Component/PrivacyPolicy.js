              If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your express consent

              If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted 
              in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only 
              as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information 
              is deleted.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              All direct payment gateways adhere to PCI-DSS standards as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which includes 
              brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.
